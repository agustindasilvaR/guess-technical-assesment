## 1. Examples

This section contains individual examples for each of the 5 requested modules. Each module is demonstrated in its own HTML file—including all the variant(s) created—and is stored in the examples directory.

- examples/drawer.html – Contains the drawer module examples (e.g., left-to-right and right-to-left variants and distinct colour)
- examples/button.html – Shows the button module with its various style options (filled, and outline)
- examples/input.html – Demonstrates the input module with its variants (flushed, outline)
- examples/slider.html – Demonstrates the slider/hero module.
- examples/photo-card.html - Shows the photo-card module and its variants (vertical and horizontal)

Each example is intended to showcase the module independently so you can verify its functionality and styling without interference from other components.

## 2. Demo

The Demo section is a complete application that integrates all of the previous components and the ones requested in the **second exercise (modal, accordion/faq)** together to form a cohesive user interface. This demo not only brings together the examples from the Examples section but also includes additional JavaScript functionality (**including content differentiation**) to enhance the overall interaction and behavior of the application.

Key points about the Demo:

  - **Integration**: All the modules (header, accordion, drawer, hero/slider, modal, input, etc.) are used in the Demo to build a complete user experience.
  -  **Additional Functionality**: The demo includes extra JavaScript features (e.g., navigation interactions, dynamic content differentiation, modal interactions) that illustrate how these components work together.
  -  **File Location**: The Demo HTML file is placed at the root of the repository **index.html** so that it’s easily accessible and can be opened directly in a browser.
